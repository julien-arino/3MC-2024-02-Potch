# A short course on Mathematical Epidemiology

These are slides and some code for a course taught during the Workshop on "Mathematical Modelling and Bio-informatics of infectious diseases", held at UKZN (Durban) in September 2023. See the web version of the repo [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/3MC-2023-12-Arba-Minch/) for more information.

Please note that at present, the slides are work in progress. I will be updating them as the course progresses.
